/*

LEGEND:
 ro - means Read Only : do not modify, must be teh same in all the route-profile files

type-name   	- the type name
type-number 	- the type associated index - read only - it is consistent with the map-content
snc		- car Speed outside cities , i.e. No City
sc		- car Speed in Cities
shc		- car Speed in Huge Cities
-----------------------------------------

TYPE NUMBER:
Several type names have the same type number: only the speeds from the first occurence of that type number are read, the others are ignored.
Those (ignored) lines can have any value, but for readability reasons they should have the same values
-----------------------------------------

LINE ORDER
The order of the lines is irrelevant, their order can be changed.
-----------------------------------------

FILE SYNTAX
Lines of interest must start with "H:" 
Any other line is ignored. (One line comment)
Also everything between a line starting with "/*" and a line containg "* /" --> with no space in between, is also ignored, including the ones starting with "H:" (Multiline comment)
-----------------------------------------

FUTURE
In future new columns or lines might have to be added.
-----------------------------------------
